# Traffic and Transportation Engineering in Colorado Springs

### Overview:
The Traffic and Transportation Engineering department of Colorado Springs is part of the city’s broader infrastructure management system. Located southeast of Denver, Colorado Springs has historically faced challenges in updating its traffic systems to keep pace with the city’s growth. Since the 1970s, the city’s traffic management system has relied on traditional technologies and static systems, which have proven to be increasingly difficult for managing the needs of a growing population. Recently, Colorado Springs launched ConnectCOS, the first initiative in decades that incorporates Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technology, such as traffic video detectors, cameras, and sensors, to improve traffic management. While ConnectCOS is a significant step forward, the city’s traffic system still heavily relies on old infrastructure, and there remains an opportunity to further implement newer technologies to improve traffic flow and optimize the use of the existing ITS infrastructure.
